V2 Changelog
============
Created an array to store UIButtons (outlet collection).
Command+click to rename connections.  Do not rename in method, otherwise connection will be broken.
Emojis are now stored in an Array<String> called emojiChoices.  Every card has its own emoji.
Use if let <varname> to check if the variable is set and to prevent crashes.  See line 47 in ViewController.swift.
