V3 Change log
==============
MVC (Model View Controller)
Model: is the WHAT of your application (but not how it is displayed).
    Knows how to match, flip cards but nothing about how it appears on screen
Controller; is the HOW model is presented to the user (UI Logic).
View: is your controller's minions.  Communicates with model to get UI.  Very generic.

Controller can always talk directly to their model.  Can talk to anyone.
The model and view should never speak to each other.
    The model is UI independent.
    View objects are generic (Buttons, labels) have no idea about the model.

View to Controller has to be a blind and structured connection.
    When doing connections in storyboard.  For ex: dragging a button to an outlet
    Views cannot own data they display.
A controllers job is to interpret/format Model information for the view.
    Center of all communication
Model can communicate with controller using a Notification and KVO.  (Model sends a radio signal and Controller tunes in to get those changes).

No longer need flipCard() because the logic is handled in updateViewFromModel();

This version implements an Initial Model View Controller to Concentration.  Will be improved in V4.
