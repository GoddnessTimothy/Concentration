V3 Change log
==============
MVC (Model View Controller)
Model: is the WHAT of your application (but not how it is displayed).
    Knows how to match, flip cards but nothing about how it appears on screen
Controller; is the HOW model is presented to the user (UI Logic).
View: is your controller's minions.  Communicates with model to get UI.

Controller can always talk directly to their model.
The model and view should never speak to each other.
The model is UI independent.  

No longer need flipCard() because the logic is handled in updateViewFromModel();

This version implements a Model View Controller to Concentration.
